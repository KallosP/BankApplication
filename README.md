# BankApplication
Includes a checking and savings account along with a simple interest calculator.
 
Both the checking and savings accounts have the same functionality for the most part: can check current balance, make a deposit, make a withdrawal, and view a previous transaction. The values for the current balance and transactions are kept separate for each respective account. 

The savings account has an extra option to access a simple interest calculator. Calculates the total amount of savings plus the initial investment provided by the user based on the number of months and interest rate entered.

Menus are included to navigate through the bank account.
